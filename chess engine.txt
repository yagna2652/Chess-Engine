   1. In order to get all possible moves for black, we need to get all possible moves for white
 Pseudo code
-> get all possible moves
-> generate all possible moves for the opposing player
-> see if any moves attacks your king
-> if your king is safe, it is a valid move and add it to a list
-> return the list of valid moves only

How do we tell python that two moves are equal?
--> By using overriding and equals method from java.

The move ID will be similar to a Hash Function
